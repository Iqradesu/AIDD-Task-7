Task 7 
Short Note on SPECKit Plus:-

SPECKit Plus is an AI-native framework that helps teams design, plan, and build software in a structured way. It breaks development into simple phases so that ideas become clear specifications, organized plans, actionable tasks, and finally working implementations. It removes confusion by giving a step-by-step workflow that anyone can follow, even beginners.

Short Answers for the 5 Core Concepts:-

1 /constitution

The Constitution phase defines why the project exists.it creates the foundational rules that will guide every part of your research paper project. It captures the mission,the vision of the  project, problem statement, target users, and success criteria. This phase gives the project direction so the team stays aligned with the main purpose from start to end.

2 /specify

The Specify phase turns ideas into clear and detailed requirements. It includes describing features, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements.

3 /plan

The Plan phase organizes how the project will be executed. It includes deciding priorities, breaking work into milestones, estimating time, assigning responsibilities, and defining workflows. This ensures the project is realistic, structured, and efficient.

4 /tasks

The Tasks phase converts the plan into small, actionable items. Each task is clear, measurable, and easy to assign. This phase reduces complexity by dividing big features into manageable pieces that can be tracked individually.

5 /implement

The Implement phase is where the actual building happens. AI writes code, test features, integrate components, and ensure everything works as specified. The goal is to produce a working, high-quality version of the product according to the earlier phases.
